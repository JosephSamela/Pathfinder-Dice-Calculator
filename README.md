# Pathfinder-Dice-Calculator
Math is hard. Use a calculator.

When you're DM for a party of 10 in combat with 25 NPCs each moving and attacking on tricky terrain with buffs, status, environmental effects -- you're rolling a lot of dice. 

Don't get me wrong I love the analog experience of good old-fashion dice rolls and tracking stats with paper and clipboard. But sometimes this slows us down -- the 3 hour campaign reaches hour 6. It's 1am. Todd can't roll a dice without dropping it. Speed up the game. More adventure. More exploration. Better stories.
